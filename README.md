# Welcome to My Website :cherry_blossom: Poggers! :cherry_blossom:
Hi, my name is Gajin and I'm a software consultant working for [Source Allies](https://www.sourceallies.com/)!

## Purpose?
- Showing off projects I've been working on
- Practicing deploying a static website using an S3 Bucket
- Keeping React skills sharp :maple_leaf:

## Running locally
### Environment setup
Navigate to the project directory and ensure you're using the correct version of Node. Then, install the Node dependencies with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/).
```bash
$ cd personal-website

# ensure node version is correct
$ nvm use

# install dependencies
$ npm i
```

### Run or generate the website
Run the application as a static page.

```bash
# serve the static site
$ npm run start
```

## Testing
